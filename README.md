# Instalments widget

This is my solution for a tech challenge in which I had to build a plug-and-play widget to calculate instalment costs of a product.

## The challenge

This company provides e-commerce shops (merchants) a flexible payment method so their customers (shoppers) can purchase the goods paying in instalments. The company has analyzed, that this kind of payment method requires a biggest effort in promotion by part of the merchant to make a difference in purchases quantity and average amount.

The marketing team is now asking you to make a prototype of a widget that displays the financing cost for a given product for merchant's product page. They also ask you that they would want to know any shopper interaction with the widget to analyze if the widget has any impact.

We expect you to:

- Create the prototype for the mockups that the marketing team has given you (`mockups.png`)
  - Integrate the prototype with `CreditAgreementAPI` (`docs/credit_agreement_api.md`) to fetch financing information for a given product value.
  - Integrate the prototype with `EventsAPI` (`docs/events_api.md`) triggering an event for each shopper interaction.
- Integrate the prototype in the merchant sample site (`merchant-site/product-page.html`) so that every time the product price changes the financing value is updated.
- Write up a paragraph with the way you would distribute this prototype to all our merchants.
