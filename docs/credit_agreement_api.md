# Credit Agreements API

The credit agreement API allows a merchant to get the company's credit conditions with a single request.

The company's credit conditions depend on order value, currency, and merchant.

A merchant should display the company's credit conditions to the shopper any time before the checkout.

## Request: `GET <base>/credit_agreements`
